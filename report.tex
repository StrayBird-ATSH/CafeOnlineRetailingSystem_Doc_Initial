\chapter{Overview of this Lab}
% Wang, Chen below
\section{The Objectives of the Project}
We are going to try to learn to use the code unit testing tools, e.g. JUnit/JMock, in this lab so as to experience test-driven development and the influence of the change in code quality and requirements on the process of development.
\par
The specifications, division of work and the detailed implementation of the work is shown in the sections below.
\section{Specifications of the Lab}
In this lab, we are required to accomplish the tasks including designing and implementing new interfaces, performing unit tesing design and development and some other works. Specifically, the works are in the form of the following parts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Implement the interfaces as required in the lab requirements;
\item Perform code unit testing design and develop code unit test;
\item Link the code commits with the project work items in the project planning;
\item Develop in groups based on Git and hand in the lab report.
\par
Our group members acted actively in their own roles together to finish the whole project and below are the detailed working results of our group.
\end{enumerate}
\section{The division of work in the team}
\subsection{Division of work: Huang, Jiani}
Build the JUnit environment and write all required environmental methods except the \emph{@test} method, such as \emph{@before} and \emph{@after}; write the \emph{@test} method for the \emph{login} method.
\subsection{Division of work: Liu, Jiaxing}
Write the \emph{checkName} and \emph{checkPassword} test method.
\subsection{Division of work: Wang, Chen}
Complete the \emph{checkName} and \emph{checkPassword} methods.
\subsection{Division of work: Tang, Xinyue}
Finish the test method of \emph{signUp}, \emph{checkStatus} and \emph{cost}.

\section{User name checking}
\subsection{Requirements for user name checking}
The username should satisfy the following requirements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The username must start with \textbf{starbb\_};
\item The username can consist of \textbf{letters}, \textbf{numbers} and \textbf{underline}, excluding any other symbols;
\item The username should have a length greater than or equal to 8 and less than 50.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Interface for the checking method}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=java]
/**
 * Check whether the given name is valid
 *
 * @param name the given name to check
 * @return whether the name is valid
 */
boolean checkName(String name);
\end{lstlisting}
\section{Password checking}
\subsection{Requirements for user name checking}
The password should satisfy the following requirements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The password can consist of \textbf{letters}, \textbf{numbers} and \textbf{\_}, excluding any other symbols;
\item The password must consist of all the three types, i.e. \textbf{letters}, \textbf{numbers} and \textbf{\_}, excluding any other symbols;
\item The password should have a length greater than or equal to 8 and less than 100.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Interface for the checking method}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=java]
/**
 * Check whether the given password is valid
 *
 * @param password the given password to check
 * @return whether the password is valid
 */
boolean checkPassword(String password);
\end{lstlisting}
% Wang, Chen above
\chapter{Features tested in the project}
\section{Login method}
%Huang, Jiani below
\par The whole test for login can be divided into two functions: the one for login successfully and the other for login failure.
\subsection{Login successfully}
\par assertTrue method is used in this test function. If the login() method returns true, then the test method will be passed.
\subsection{Login failed}
\par If we fail to login, a runtime exception will be thrown. AssertEquals method is used in this test function to handle the exception message. By comparing the two strings, we successfully test th login failure situation.
\subsubsection{User Is Null}
 \par If the username input doesn't exist in the database, the exception message will be " Entity not found." 
\subsubsection{Password Is Incorrect}
\par If the username matches but password does not in the database, the exception message will be "password or username error.". 
%Huang, Jiani above
\section{Sign up method}
%Tang, Xinyue below
\par The test for signUp can be divided into two functions: the one for signUp successfully and the other for signUp failure.
\subsection{signUp successfully}
\par assertTrue method is used in this test function.
\par To make sure we use a name that doesn't exist in user.csv, I used Date to construct a new name.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=java]
    Date date = new Date();
    String name = (new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy_MM_dd_hh_mm_ss")).format(date);
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{signUp failed}
\par assertFalse method is used in this test function. SignUp function will return false if the user name already exists.

%Tang, Xinyue above
\section{Username checking method}
%Liu, Jiaxing below
\par The test for username checking method consists of two parts: the one for legal name and the other for illegal one.
\subsection{Legal name}
\par I construct a string--starbb\_12AC--and it begins with the string starbb\_, and contains letters and digits. Therefore, it's legal.
\subsection{Illegal name}
\par It's very easy to construct an illegal name. A Null string, a string with other special characters, a string not beginning with the specified string and a much shorter or longer one all are wrong names. So I design 5 methods to cover all situations. In the beginning, I forgot to consider the situation that the name may be null. Thanks to WangChen's advice, I take it into account.
\par Username checking methods are more complex than others, and they contain many situations. 
%Liu, Jiaxing above
\section{Password checking method}
%Liu, Jiaxing below
\par The test for password checking method consists of two parts: the one for legal password and the other for illegal one.
\subsection{Legal password}
\par I construct a string--123\_abc12--and it contains letters, digits and underline. Therefore, it's legal.
\subsection{Illegal password}
\par A legal password must contain all the three types: \textbf{letters}, \textbf{numbers} and \textbf{\_}. So in order to get a illegal password, there are many ways. Null password, a string without digits, a string without letters, a string without underline, a string with other special characters and a much shorter or longer one all are OK. So I design 7 methods to test. 

%Liu, Jiaxing above
\section{Status checking method}
%Tang, Xinyue below
\par The test for status checking method can be divided into two functions: the one for user login successfully and the other for user has not logged in.
\subsection{status is logged in }
\par we let a true user to login and then assertTrue checkStatus;

\subsection{status is not logged in}
\par assertFalse method is used in this test function.
this test works well when runing separately, but failed when runing the whole Lab2ApplicationTests program.
Liu, Jiaxing fixed this problem by adding:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=java]
    @FixMethodOrder(MethodSorters.NAME_ASCENDING)
\end{lstlisting}

%Tang, Xinyue above
\section{Cost checking method}
%Tang, Xinyue below
\par The test for cost method can be divided into five functions.

\subsection{testCostOK for cappuccino and espresso}
\par we assertEquals the cost's result and the manually calculated value;

\subsection{testCost for NumberError}
\par catch a COFFEE NUMBER ERROR when the number of coffee is less than zero.

\subsection{testCost for CupErrors}
\par catch a CUP SIZE ERROR when the cup SIZE of coffee is less than 1 or more than 3.

\subsection{testCost for Null}
\par catch a ORDER Null when passing in a null value to the cost function
